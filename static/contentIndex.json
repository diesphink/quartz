To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nJack of all trades (Bard)\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest (Bard)\nCurrent: 1d8\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\nThe extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nHexblade’s Curse (Hexblade)\nStarting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:\n\nYou gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.\nAny attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.\nIf the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).\n\nYou can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\nHex warrior (hexblade)\nThe influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.\nBard College: Spirits\nGuiding Whispers (Spirits)\nAt 3rd level, you can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the Guidance cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of bard cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.\nSpiritual Focus (Spirits)\nAt 3rd level, you employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.\nTales from Beyond\nAt 3rd level, you reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale’s effect or you finish a short or long rest.\nYou can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until you roll it again.\nYou can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.\nIf the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBardic Insp. DieTale Told Through You1Tale of the Clever Animal. For the next 10 minutes, whenever the target makes an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma check, the target can roll an extra die immediately after rolling the d20 and add the extra die’s number to the check. The extra die is the same type as your Bardic Inspiration die.2Tale of the Renowned Duelist. You make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier.3Tale of the Beloved Friends. The target and another creature of its choice it can see within 5 feet of it gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier4Tale of the Runaway. The target can immediately use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the target teleports, it can choose a number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) to immediately use the same reaction.5Tale of the Avenger. For 1 minute, any creature that hits the target with a melee attack takes force damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.6Tale of the Traveler. The target gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your bard level. While it has these temporary hit points, the target’s walking speed increases by 10 feet and it gains a +1 bonus to its AC.7Tale of the Beguiler. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die, and the target is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.8Tale of the Phantom. The target becomes invisible until the end of its next turn or until it hits a creature with an attack. If it hits a creature with an attack during this invisibility, the creature it hits takes necrotic damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die and is frightened of the target until the end of the frightened creature’s next turn.\nExpertise: Persuasion, Perception\nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\nFont of Inspiration\nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.\nCountercharm\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).\nSpirit Session\nAt 6th level, spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.\nThe spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of Divination or Necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of bard spells you know.\nOnce you perform the ritual, you can’t do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.\n\nAttacks\nCharisma on attack and damage of the sword for hex warrior\nSword (1h): +9 (+4 prof, +5 cha), 1d8+5 (+5 cha)\nSword (2h): +9 (+4 prof, +5 cha), 1d10+5 (+5 cha)\nEnergy sword (1h): +9 (+4 prof, +5 cha), 1d8+5 +1d8 fire (+5 cha)  + 1d8+5 fire on other (+5 cha)\nEnergy sword (2h): +9 (+4 prof, +5 cha), 1d10+5 +1d8 fire (+5 cha) + 1d8+5 fire on other (+5 cha)\nEnergy bow: +9 x2 (+3 prof, +5 cha), 1d10\nDisturbing mantra: wis vs. 17, 2d4 psyc, disadv att\nExplosive mantra: con vs 17, AOE 5tf, 2d6 thunder"},"a/assets/diegopereyra.com/index":{"title":"index","links":["assets/diegopereyra.com/rpg"],"tags":[],"content":"This is the main page!\nLinks para coisas de rpg"},"a/assets/diegopereyra.com/rpg":{"title":"rpg","links":["a/3.-Resources/Bugubi","a/3.-Resources/Quimera---Level-10","a/3.-Resources/Dalton"],"tags":[],"content":"Bugubi\nQuimera - Level 10\nDalton"},"index":{"title":"index","links":["assets/diegopereyra.com/rpg"],"tags":[],"content":"This is the main page!\nLinks para coisas de rpg"},"rpg":{"title":"rpg","links":["a/3.-Resources/Bugubi","a/3.-Resources/Quimera---Level-10","a/3.-Resources/Dalton"],"tags":[],"content":"Bugubi\nQuimera - Level 10\nDalton"}}
